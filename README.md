### Cloud Backup Setup (Optional)

OMAC supports backing up your collection to Google Drive for secure offsite storage.

#### Quick Setup (Recommended)

**Option 1: From OMAC Application**
1. **Launch OMAC**
2. **Go to File → Setup Google Drive**
3. **Follow the step-by-step wizard**
4. **Drag and drop your credentials.json file** or use the file selector

**Option 2: Standalone Setup Script**
1. **Run the setup script**: `python drive_setup.py`
2. **Follow the wizard instructions**

The setup wizard will:
- Open the Google Cloud Console for you
- Guide you through enabling the Drive API
- Help you download and configure credentials
- Test the connection automatically

### Manual Setup (Advanced)

If you prefer to set it up manually:

1. **Google Cloud Console Setup**
   - Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
   - Create a new project or select existing one
   - Enable the Google Drive API
   - Create OAuth 2.0 credentials for a desktop application
   - Download the `credentials.json` file

2. **Configure OMAC**
   - Place `credentials.json` in the OMAC application directory
   - First use will prompt for Google authentication
   - Grant permission for OMAC to access Google Drive

3. **Using Cloud Backup**
   - File → "Backup to Cloud" - Creates and uploads a backup
   - File → "Manage Cloud Backups" - View, download, or restore cloud backups
   - **One-click restore**: Select a backup and click "Restore Backup" for automatic restoration
   - **Download only**: Get backup files without restoring (for manual restoration)

## Building a Standalone macOS App

To create a standalone macOS application bundle that can be distributed to other users:

### Option 1: Build App Bundle + DMG (Recommended)
```bash
./build_and_package_macos.sh
```
This creates both the application bundle and a compressed DMG file for distribution.

### Option 2: Build App Bundle Only
```bash
./build_macos_app.sh
```

### Distribution Files Created
- **Application bundle**: `dist/OMAC.app` (274MB) - The runnable application
- **Distributable DMG**: `OMAC.dmg` (113MB) - Compressed disk image for sharing

### Usage
- **Test locally**: Double-click `dist/OMAC.app`
- **Distribute**: Share the `OMAC.dmg` file with other macOS users

**Notes:**
- The first run of the built app may take longer as it creates the database
- The app bundle includes all necessary dependencies and is self-contained
- Built apps are signed and ready for distribution
- Compatible with macOS 10.15+ (argv_emulation disabled for modern macOS compatibility)
- No Python installation required on target systems

**Distribution Files:**
- `dist/OMAC.app` - macOS application bundle
- `OMAC.dmg` - Compressed disk image for easy distribution

## Usage

Run the application:
```bash
python main.py
```
